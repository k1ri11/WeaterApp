# WeaterApp
in weatherApp, you can find out the current weather, hourly weather forecast (up to 24 hours) and daily weather forecast (up to 7 days).
Also you can delete and replace cities in the list with implementing drag and drop feature.
Add new city by using search field to see forecast there, or select a previously added city.

## Project's technologies
My application developed in kotlin and using technologies such as:
+ MVVM - to maintain a clear project structure;
+ Room database - to store list of added cities;
+ Retrofit and okhttp3 - to get weather forecast from openweathermap API;
+ Kotlin corounines - to work with network and database safely.
+ Swipedecorator - to customizing the background of the swipe to delete feature
